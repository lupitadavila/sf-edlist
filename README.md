Passion Project: App that allows users to create favorite lists of SF Public Schools

## Problem
SF School district uses a lottery system when accepting students. This makes the parents' experience stressful and requires them to research and compile a list of preferences for their student that they then submit. It can be easy to lose track of what schools have been visited/researched.

## Solution
Create an app that lessens the burden of researching schools and allow users to keep track of which schools they like.

## Current Solutions available
* http://www.greatschools.org/
* https://www.schooldigger.com/go/CA/city/San+Francisco/search.aspx
* https://www.niche.com/k12/rankings/private-high-schools/best-overall/m/san-francisco-metro-area/

## Goals
* Users can sign up and create a list of preferred schools with comments
* Comments for each "liked" school allow users to add notes if they need to visit the school or have already visited
* Users can search schools and read reviews without logging in
* Users who have signed up can write reviews about their experiences with schools
* Search results page shows results on google map
* School page has basic info as well as average rating if applicable

## Stretch goals
* Users can compare schools with compare feature
* Users can create multiple lists for each child
* Include private schools
* Allow users to share their list via email or other apps (and pdf in order to print)

## API's
* SODA SF Open Dataset of Schools
* Google Maps
